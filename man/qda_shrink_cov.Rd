\description{
Given a set of training data, this function builds the Shrinkage-based
Diagonal Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (SDQDA) classifier, which is based
on the DQDA classifier, often attributed to Dudoit et al. (2002). The DQDA
classifier belongs to the family of Naive Bayes classifiers, where the
distributions of each class are assumed to be multivariate normal. To improve
the estimation of the class variances, Pang et al. (2009) proposed the SDQDA
classifier which uses a shrinkage-based estimators of each class covariance
matrix.

The SDQDA classifier is a modification to QDA, where the off-diagonal
elements of the pooled sample covariance matrix are set to zero. To improve
the estimation of the pooled variances, we use a shrinkage method from Pang
et al.  (2009).

\details{
The DQDA classifier is a modification to the well-known QDA classifier, where
the off-diagonal elements of the pooled covariance matrix are assumed to be
zero -- the features are assumed to be uncorrelated. Under multivariate
normality, the assumption uncorrelated features is equivalent to the
assumption of independent features. The feature-independence assumption is a
notable attribute of the Naive Bayes classifier family. The benefit of these
classifiers is that they are fast and have much fewer parameters to estimate,
especially when the number of features is quite large.

The matrix of training observations are given in \code{x}. The rows of
\code{x} contain the sample observations, and the columns contain the
features for each training observation.

The vector of class labels given in \code{y} are coerced to a \code{factor}.
The length of \code{y} should match the number of rows in \code{x}.

An error is thrown if a given class has less than 2 observations because the
variance for each feature within a class cannot be estimated with less than 2
observations.

The vector, \code{prior}, contains the \emph{a priori} class membership for
each class. If \code{prior} is NULL (default), the class membership
probabilities are estimated as the sample proportion of observations
belonging to each class. Otherwise, \code{prior} should be a vector with the
same length as the number of classes in \code{y}. The \code{prior}
probabilities should be nonnegative and sum to one.
