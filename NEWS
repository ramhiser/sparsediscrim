sparsediscrim 0.1
-----------------

NEW FEATURES

* First version of the `sparsediscrim` package. With this package, we aim to
  provide a large collection of regularized and sparse discriminant analysis
  classifiers intended for high-dimensional classification.

CLASSIFIERS

* `hdrda()` is an implementation of the High-Dimensional Regularized
  Discriminant Analysis classifier from Ramey, Stein, and Young (2013).

* `dlda()` is an implementation of the Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis
  classifier from Dudoit, Fridlyand, and Speed (2002).

* `dqda()` is an implementation of the Diagonal Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
  classifier from Dudoit, Fridlyand, and Speed (2002).

* `sdlda()` is an implementation of the Shrinkage-based Diagonal Linear
  Discriminant Analysis classifier from Pang, Tong, and Zhao (2009).

* `sdqda()` is an implementation of the Shrinkage-based Diagonal Quadratic
  Discriminant Analysis classifier from Pang, Tong, and Zhao (2009).

SIMULATED DATA SETS

* `generate_blockdiag()` generates random variates from K multivariate normal
  populations, where each class is generated with a constant mean vector and a
  covariance matrix consisting of block-diagonal autocorrelation matrices.

* `generate_intraclass()` generates random variates from K multivariate normal
  populations, where class is generated with a constant mean vector and an
  intraclass covariance matrix.

MISCELLANEOUS

* `cv_partition()` randomly partitions data for cross-validation.

* `no_intercept()` removes the intercept term from a formula if it is included.

* `cov_mle()` computes the maximum likelihood estimator for the sample
  covariance matrix under the assumption of multivariate normality.

* `cov_pool()` computes the pooled maximum likelihood estimator for the common
  covariance matrix under the assumption of multivariate normality.

* `cov_eigen()` computes the eigenvalue decomposition of the maximum likelihood
  estimators of the covariance matrices for the given data matrix. We provide an
  option to calculate the eigenvalue decomposition using the Fast Singular Value
  Decomposition, which can greatly expedite the eigenvalue decomposition for
  very tall data (large n, small p) or very wide data (small n, large p).
